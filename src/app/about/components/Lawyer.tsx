        The Case Against Inefficient Queuing: A Matter of Public Interest
      </h2>

      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4 text-lg">
        Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I submit to you that we, the people,
        have endured long queues at government offices not merely as a
        logistical inconvenience, but as a systemic failure—one that violates
        our time, our rights, and our collective dignity.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">
        The Plaintiff: The Malaysian Public The Defendant: An Outdated Queuing
        System
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        We present Exhibit A—a typical day at a government office. A citizen,
        let’s call him Encik Adam, arrives at JPN at 7:45 AM to renew his IC. He
        is given queue number A-1043. The current number being served? A-0012.
        Hours pass. His productivity is lost. His right to an efficient service,
        ignored.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">
        Argument 1: The Right to Efficient Public Services
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Article 5 of the Federal Constitution of Malaysia guarantees the right
        to liberty. While traditionally interpreted in criminal law, the spirit
        of this provision extends to the liberty of time—one of the most
        valuable and non-renewable assets a person possesses.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        If the government has an obligation to provide timely justice, does it
        not also have an obligation to provide timely services? The delay and
        unpredictability of the current queuing system is, at best, a failure of
        administration; at worst, a silent theft of the people's time.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">
        Argument 2: A Violation of Administrative Justice
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Under the principles of good governance, a government institution must
        act reasonably, efficiently, and with procedural fairness. The absence
        of an advanced e-queuing system contradicts these very principles. Why
        must a citizen be physically present to claim a queue number? Why is
        there no real-time transparency on waiting times? Why is there no
        digital alternative?
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        The government has the power to modernize this process, yet the inaction
        itself could be argued as administrative negligence.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">
        The Solution: A Legally Sound, Logically Necessary Reform
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        The prosecution proposes a simple, enforceable solution: the Malaysia
        Integrated E-Queuing System (MIEQS)—a system that allows individuals to:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-300 space-y-2">
        <li>
          Secure their queue number remotely—eliminating the need for
          unnecessary physical waiting.
        </li>
        <li>
          Access real-time queue updates—ensuring procedural transparency.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce congestion and administrative burden—improving the experience
          for both citizens and government personnel.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">
        Final Statement: The Verdict is Yours
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        We stand at a crossroads between modern efficiency and archaic
        inefficiency. We must ask ourselves: Do we continue to tolerate a
        queuing system that disregards our time, or do we demand the reform that
        technology has already made possible?
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Your time is your right. The choice is clear. The time for change is
        now.
