        The 'Syok Sendiri' Project
      </h2>

      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4 text-lg">
        <strong>"Is this another syok sendiri project?"</strong> Oh, absolutely.
        Do I genuinely believe I’ll finish this? <strong>Probably not. </strong>
        Will I get mad if someone snatches this idea, adds a couple of
        unnecessary ‘improvements’ (like a button that does nothing) and then
        sells it to the government for a fat contract?{" "}
        <strong>Not at all.</strong>
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Well… maybe just a little. But not because they stole my idea—nah, I
        expect that. It’s because I’ll have to watch them butcher it with
        pointless bureaucracy, clunky UI, and some outdated system that still
        requires you to print something out <em>for no damn reason.</em>
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        <strong>But hear me out.</strong> If this project ever becomes real, if
        one day Malaysians can actually book a queue number for JPN, JPJ, or
        even Imigresen <em>without</em> waking up at 6 AM just to still be
        number 200 in line, I’d be happy. No, seriously.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Even if I don’t get a Proton S70 as a ‘thank you’ gift, even if I don’t
        end up with a nice landed house with a big porch where I can sip teh
        tarik and laugh at people still queuing physically, I’ll be fine.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Because <strong>this all started from frustration.</strong> Not some
        grand ambition to ‘revolutionize’ government services or win a tech
        award. No, this idea was born the moment I spent
        <strong> TWO. FREAKING. HOURS. </strong> at{" "}
        <strong>JPN Bukit Raja</strong>, watching the numbers crawl at a speed
        slower than TM’s Unifi during peak hours.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">
        Why Though?
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        I sat there thinking, <em>Why?</em>{" "}
        <em>Why are we still doing this?</em>
        <em>Why do I have to physically be here just to take a number?</em>
        <em>
          Why do I have to stare at a giant LED board like it’s some kind of
          gambling result,
        </em>
        hoping my number shows up before I turn 80?
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        And that’s when it hit me—
        <strong>this system doesn’t have to be like this.</strong>
        We have e-wallets, food delivery, online banking, and yet, queue numbers
        still work like they did in 1995? Make it make sense.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-300 mt-6 text-lg font-semibold">
        So, if MIEQS ever sees the light of day, if even ONE Malaysian gets to
        save those painful hours and do something better with their life—be it
        work, sleep, or scrolling TikTok guilt-free— then this little ‘syok
        sendiri’ project? <strong>Totally worth it.</strong>
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">
        Oh yeah, would this project actually work?
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        About that... <em>ehhhh, not sure.</em>
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        See, different branches have their own way of handling things. One JPN
        branch might be chill, while another might make you feel like you’re on
        a side quest just to renew your IC. So, a <strong>standardized</strong>{" "}
        system like this? With—<em>respectfully</em>—those higher-ups (
        <em>please don’t visit my house</em>), it’s gonna take more than just an
        idea. It’ll need actual <strong>reformasi</strong>—the kind that doesn’t
        just exist in speeches, but in real, functional change.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        And let’s be real—I’m <strong>definitely</strong> not the first person
        to propose this. I guarantee there have been <strong>dozens</strong> of
        people who already suggested something similar, maybe even more
        advanced, only to get snubbed by <strong>you know what. </strong>
        Either someone didn’t see the “value” (a.k.a. no opportunity to siphon
        extra budget), or the idea got lost in the{" "}
        <strong>bureaucratic black hole of endless meetings.</strong>
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Or maybe, just <em>maybe</em>, they <strong>are</strong> already working
        on this, quietly, behind the scenes. If that’s the case, then{" "}
        <strong>thank you.</strong> Seriously. If this system already exists or
        is on its way, I’ll gladly take back everything I said— except the part
        about waiting two hours at JPN Bukit Raja. That trauma stays.
